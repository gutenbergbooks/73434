<p class='c005'>It is my object in these instructions to lay before
the undertakers of this country a minute and detailed
description of the <i>only reliable</i> process, and <i>best method
known</i>, for the preservation and embalming of the
dead, and at the same time to submit to them the important
details to be followed out so condensed and
free from unnecessary and superfluous language that
the methods used shall be plain to any one, believing
that any matter not strictly pertaining to the subject
is out of place in a Manual of Instruction.</p>

<p class='c006'>Long study and experiment in this interesting
science has brought to light many valuable and practical
results, and it is from actual tests and experiments
extending over nearly a quarter of a century
that I have devoted to this subject that has enabled
me to say that with the aid of my Excelsior Preservative
the Undertaker may rely with entire and perfect
confidence, upon meeting with complete success
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>in each and every case to which he may be called,
and I can assure him that after using the Excelsior
Preservative, he will have no desire to return to the
use of ice, or any other preparation he may have
used in the past.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Egyptians embalmed their dead by a tedious
process, which occupied from sixty to ninety days—constant
attention and care being required. They
always removed the brain, stomach and intestines,
which last were sometimes deprived of their excrement
and replaced in the body, and when they were
called to embalm very fleshy subjects all of the adipose
or fatty substances that could be removed were
taken out of the bodies; this done, they were next
bathed, or even immersed, in a solution of Arsenic,
Asphaltum, Oil of Cedar, Gum Myrrh, and any or all
of the aromatic spices that they could possess themselves
of without respect to kind or quantity. After
which the body was subjected to slow and steady
heat for from sixty to ninety days; the application of
the solution being repeated several times (smoke was
also used in some cases); when the moisture was finally
expelled from the body they were wrapped or
rather wound with narrow strips of linen cloth from
head to foot. These cloths were also saturated with
Asphaltum, Arsenic and Gum Myrrh, which soon became
dried and cemented together in a manner to
prevent moisture from permeating the body as long
as the wrapping remained intact.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus it will be observed that the Egyptian method
is not a lost art, as has been supposed, neither
would any person living under the present age of
improvement allow it to be practiced on their dead.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>It has been often remarked by those not informed
in such matters, that the Egyptian method could not
be fully analyzed or a new and better method discovered
to take its place; but, fortunately, this is a great
mistake.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Peruvians equalled the Egyptian method
without removing anything from the body, and all
they used was smoke and heat. When the moisture
was fully evaporated from the body it was placed
in a dry, rocky tomb. Many of these <i>mummies</i> have
been discovered in a fine state of preservation, and
few, if any, are prepared to say but that these ancient
dead have been lying in their rock-hewn tombs
as long as the so-called Egyptian mummies have
in the catacombs of Egypt.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have given the above, as you will be asked many
times in regard to the Egyptian method of embalming,
and it will be a very great advantage to you in
being able to give the information called for.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are a number of so-called preserving or
embalming preparations, sold as such (some having a
little merit as a temporary preservative), but <i>none of
them</i> possessing all the requirements of a perfect preservative,
deodorizer and embalming compound.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Perfection</i>, however, has been attained in the Excelsior
Preservative, it being a perfect deodorizer, and
for preserving and embalming the dead <i>it surpasses
anything known</i> either in <i>ancient</i> or <i>modern</i> times.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having explained the ancient method of preserving
the dead, I will now take up the science as perfected,
with the aid of the Excelsior Preservative and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the practical instructions, which I herewith lay before
you.</p>

<p class='c006'>With this manual in your possession, you will be
enabled to attain that perfection in the art of preserving
and embalming the dead which the educated and
refined taste of the people of this day require of your
profession.</p>

  <h2 id='II' class='c004'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='c014'>Directions for the Care of Ordinary Cases.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>To handle and preserve an ordinary case in warm
weather, when the body is only to be kept one or two
days, the undertaker will find my process very much
easier than any of the old methods (in fact not half
the work). In a case of this kind (as the ice-box or
icing is done away with or omitted), all the undertaker
has to do is to lay the body out, with the head
from ten to twelve inches higher than the feet (<i>the
higher the head the better</i>), and inject with the Syringe,
using the large bent tube, say one-half of a pint of
the Preservative into the nose or mouth, which will
immediately run down the throat into the lungs and
stomach, and prevent any fermentation or decay of
any substance that may be in them. The body
should be raised up in the sitting posture if there is
any difficulty in injecting down the throat.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then wet a large cloth (<i>a large towel is the best</i>,)
with the Preservative and lay it over the chest and
abdomen. This should be kept wet with the Preservative
from four to eight hours, the longer the better;
also wet cloths with the Preservative and lay over
the face and hands. Be particular to press the cloth
down well around the eyes, ears and neck. This
effectually prevents any discoloration, or if it has already
turned dark, the complexion will be restored
as white as in life.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>These cloths should also be kept wet with the
Preservative from four to six hours, and even longer
in some cases; this is all very quickly done, and easy
to do by any one after they once understand it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now leave the body in this position on the inclined
board for about 18 to 24 hours, when it can
be dressed and placed in the casket. The cloths
can now be removed from the face during the day,
but should be replaced during the night and be kept
wet with the Preservative, as a certain preventative
against discoloration.</p>

<p class='c006'>The undertaker can leave orders with the friends
to wet these cloths and lay them over the face at
night, thus saving himself the trouble of going back
to look after it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Remember, it is always best to let the body lie in
the inclined position about 24 hours before placing it
in the casket, and if kept in the casket over night
the foot end of the casket should be lowered during
the night-time in order that the inclined position
of the body may be retained.</p>

  <h2 id='III' class='c004'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='c014'>Directions to Observe in a More Obstinate Case.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>When the body is to be kept longer, it is best to
first empty the stomach of whatever mucous or other
substance can be got out of it. This is done easiest
by turning the body onto its side, with the head
drooping a little over the side of the bed or couch
or whatever the body may be lying upon, and by
pressing with your hand upon the stomach a portion
of its contents will run out.</p>

<p class='c006'>A washbowl or chamber, placed in a chair, is
handiest for this purpose. (And here I would say,
it is always best to inject into the stomach about one-quarter
of a pint of the Preservative before attempting
to empty it, as this will so effectually deodorize
the contents of the stomach that no offensive odor or
smell will arise when you empty it into the vessel,
thus keeping the room free from stench.)</p>

<p class='c006'>Immediately after emptying the stomach, place
the body in an inclined position, with the head ten
or twelve inches higher than the feet, as before stated
(preferably on the cooling board if you have one, and
the steeper the incline the better), and again inject
with the syringe about one pint of the Preservative
into the stomach.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>This, as before stated, will effectually prevent
any further fermentation or decay of any substance
remaining in the stomach.</p>

<p class='c006'>And as a further safeguard against any substance
running out of the mouth, and consequent staining
of the pillow or lining of the casket, it is well to stop
up the throat with a little cotton. For this purpose
you should have an instrument (it may be of wood)
made in the shape of a spoon handle and about eight
inches long; with this you can easily push a ball of
cotton saturated with the Preservative well down
the throat. This is a precaution that should <i>never</i> be
omitted when the body is to be kept any great length
of time, or when it has to be transported on the cars
or other conveyance to any distance.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is well to stop up the nose in the same way,
but it must be done very neatly, so as not to show
or change the appearance of it. Having thus attended
to the stomach, you will next bathe the face,
neck and whole body (if at all convenient), with the
Preservative, using for this purpose a large lather
brush, which is better than a sponge or cloth, as you
can do the work much quicker and easier with the
brush.</p>

<p class='c006'>The rectum at this time should be injected with
the Preservative and stopped with a ball of cotton
saturated with the same. <i>This should be well done</i>,
to guard against purging, and should never be omitted
where there is any apparent danger of purging,
or where the body is to be moved to any considerable
distance before burial. Also puncture the abdomen
with the Gas-trocar, and inject through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Gas-trocar into the cavity of the body around the
bowels about one pint of the Preservative.</p>

<p class='c006'>A large cloth or towel should also be wet with
the Preservative and laid over the chest and abdomen,
covering it well over; and in order that it will hold
the moisture for several hours, it is best that the
cloth should be several thicknesses over the abdomen,
and should be kept wet with the Preservative by
pouring from the bottle along the center of the cloth
from time to time as long as the body is to be kept,
or during the first two days when the burial is to
take place on the third day, and if the burial is to
take place on the fourth, fifth or sixth day, this cloth
should be kept wet the first <i>three</i> days, and when the
body is to be kept <i>ten or fifteen days</i>, this cloth should
be kept wet proportionately longer.</p>

<p class='c006'>This part of the work should be remembered and
well attended to, as it is a well-known fact that
decomposition and putrescence first makes its appearance
in the bowels and stomach.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is here the Preservative does its most thorough
work, as, by keeping the cloths wet over the abdomen
and stomach, the Preservative, to a very great extent,
<i>permeates the whole body</i>, and is a valuable safeguard
against bloating; and if bloating has not already
commenced, it will never make its appearance after
you commence to use the Preservative as above
directed, and in very many cases it has been known
to arrest and reduce bloating by its use as directed.
As much depends upon absorption, the more of the
Preservative there is applied externally, as above
directed, the better results there will be obtained.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>The face, neck, ears and hands should be well
bathed with the Preservative, using the brush for
this purpose, and if the ears have turned black you
can remove the color in five minutes by keeping them
wet with the Preservative, and pressing or squeezing
them with your hand, and it is always well to do
this when they have turned very dark.</p>

<p class='c006'>However, the cloths that you have before been
instructed to wet with the Preservative and lay over
the face, neck and hands, will effectually remove all
discoloration or prevent its appearance.</p>

<p class='c006'>These cloths should be well pressed down around
the eyes, nose, neck and ears, so as to be sure that
the cloths touch every spot. The cloths can be kept
moist by applying a little of the Preservative from
time to time, without removing the cloths to wet
them. These cloths should be kept on from ten to
twelve hours, after which they can be removed
through the day and replaced through the night.</p>

<p class='c006'>If this process is kept up there will be a natural
and life-like appearance preserved, without the least
discoloration, and the face will look better at the end
of the third or fourth day, or even a week, than it
did at death. In the <span class='fss'>FREE USE</span> of this Preservative,
the longer you keep a body the better it will look.</p>

<p class='c006'>The use of the Preservative in this way will not
only preserve the body, but will effectually purify
and deodorize the room, driving away all offensive
smell, however bad it might have been at first, and
perfectly disinfecting the house of all possibility of
contagion, thus insuring safety to yourself and preventing
further spread of the disease in the family.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>This entire process will take less than thirty
minutes of your time. The body should be kept in
the inclined position from 20 to 30 hours, with the
head at least twelve inches higher than the feet, (the
easiest way to obtain this position is to drop the foot
end of the board on the floor), at the end of which
time it can be dressed and placed in the casket, but
the dress should be left loose, so that the cloths over
the chest and abdomen can be wet from time to time
with the Preservative, as before directed, or you can
insert the Gas-trocar through the clothing and inject
the Preservative in on to the body and thus keep the
cloths wet, and if kept in the casket over night, lower
the foot end of it, as before directed.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is also well to leave directions with the friends
to bathe the face and neck once in two or three hours
with the Preservative, using the brush for that purpose,
and the cloths should be replaced on the face
and hands during the night, as before stated.</p>

<p class='c006'>A body treated in the foregoing manner can be
kept for a <i>week or ten days</i> in any kind of weather
(<i>the very warmest</i>) with perfect safety, and with comparatively
little trouble to yourself you will have
conferred a very great favor on the friends of the
deceased, by thus giving them an opportunity of
looking upon the remains from day to day, as often
and as long as they wish, and also giving them all the
time they may want to arrange and re-arrange the
dress, hair and flowers preparatory to the funeral.
It will readily be seen that this would be <i>very much
more satisfactory</i> to any one, and much more in keeping
with the refined taste of the present day, than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>the practice of hiding the body away to be <i>frozen</i> in
the <span class='fss'>UNSIGHTLY ICE BOX</span>, which is always a <span class='fss'>HORROR</span> to
the friends of the deceased.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='IV' class='c004'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='c014'>Directions to Observe in a still More Obstinate and Difficult Case.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Where the body is badly bloated, when you are
first called, it is best, immediately after attending to
the stomach (as before instructed) to let off the gas
from the cavities of the body. This is best done with
the Gas-trocar, if you have one, as with this instrument,
and having a small rubber pipe attached to it,
you can puncture the abdomen or cavity of the body
with the point of the Gas-trocar, and by extending
the rubber pipe out of the window, the gas (which
has a very offensive odor), will pass out of the window
through the pipe, thus saving any disagreeable
smell, for the time being, in the room. Many
however, puncture the abdomen in several places and
let the gas off in the room, as the Preservative will
soon deodorize and purify the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is sometimes necessary to puncture the body
in two or three places, in order to get rid of all the
gasses, but seldom more than once, as in nine cases
out of ten the gas will all escape in less than two
minutes from one opening.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Immediately after the gas has escaped, insert the
point of the Syringe and inject one or two pints of
the Excelsior Preservative into the cavity of the
abdomen, which will pass all around the bowels and
arrest any further decomposition or putrescence, and
entirely prevent any further accumulation of gas or
possibility of bloating. You can inject the Preservative
through the Gas-trocar.</p>

<p class='c006'>If you have found it necessary to make more than
one incision with the Gas-trocar or knife, it is well
to inject some of the Preservative into every opening
made, even to the extent of three pints or more.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whenever it is desirable for any reason to avoid
leaving any external mark of the puncture, it should
be made at the navel, first drawing the loose fold of
skin at one side and puncturing through the navel;
then, when the trocar is withdrawn the loose skin
around the navel returns to its natural position. The
trocar can be pointed downwards and to each side,
injecting some of the Preservative in each place, thus
accomplishing the thorough injection of the abdominal
cavity from only one point of insertion.</p>

<p class='c006'>In case it may be deemed necessary to inject the
thorax (or cavity of the chest) raise or extend one
of the arms and puncture and inject through the
axilla or armpit.</p>

<p class='c006'>The stomach may be reached from the point of
insertion at the navel by pointing the Gas-trocar upwards
at an acute angle, inclining it a little to the
left in a line with the top of the left shoulder. The
foregoing methods of injection have the advantage of
leaving no visible trace of the operation.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>It is also <i>important</i> (and <i>not to be forgotten</i>) to
puncture the bladder with the Gas-trocar and draw
off the urine. This is easily done by placing a washbowl
or chamber in a chair and, after puncturing the
bladder, turn the body on its side, and the urine will
escape through the instrument at once, but if in some
cases it might not escape through the Gas-trocar
readily in this position it certainly <i>will</i> by raising the
body to a sitting posture.</p>

<p class='c006'>The point for the insertion of the Trocar to reach
the bladder is just at the top of the <i>os pubes</i> or pubic
bone (the bone uniting the hips in front at the bottom
of the abdominal cavity), making the puncture in a
line with the navel as near the top of the bone as you
can and inclining the point of the Trocar a little
downwards behind the bone.</p>

<p class='c006'>Remember, always after the urine has been taken
away, to inject <i>at least</i> half a pint of the Preservative
into the bladder. It is important that this part of
the work should be well done, for unless this precaution
is taken, the urine is certain to escape more or
less in the natural way on the second or third day.</p>

<p class='c006'>And whenever the bladder is <i>not</i> thus attended to,
you must <i>never</i> omit the simple precaution of putting
on a good heavy diaper; say, double up a large sheet
and use plenty of cotton well saturated with the
Preservative, and do up the parts as snugly as a
mother would her child, remembering to saturate
these cloths again the second, third and fourth day,
by pouring Preservative from the bottle on the diapers,
thus deodorizing any escape that may have
taken place, in order that there may be no disagreeable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>smell arising from this source on the day
of the funeral.</p>

<p class='c006'>This part of the practice is not new to those well
up in the profession, but I have thought best to call
your attention to these facts in order that no important
point should be overlooked by any one.</p>

<p class='c006'>This done, in addition to the treatment according
to the foregoing instructions, I term partial embalming,
and the entire time consumed in thus taking care
of a body will not exceed one hour. And if the Preservative
<i>is used freely</i> and my instructions are carried
out in this process of treating a case, there will <i>never
be a failure</i>, and the body in <i>every instance</i> will be as
effectually preserved for ten, twenty or thirty days,
as it would under a treatment of full embalming for
all time.</p>

  <h2 id='V' class='c004'>CHAPTER V.<br> <span class='c014'>Cases Indicating Absence of Immediate Results.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In some cases the appearances of the body
under treatment may indicate a want of immediate
results from the application of the Preservative as
the same case would from any kind of treatment.
Which may be from the fact that from the nature of
the disease or from circumstances connected with the
death of the subject, decomposition sets in very rapidly,
in some cases the blood and fluids of the body
being in a state of rapid progress towards disintegration
even before death, and although the Preservative
permeates the tissues of the body very readily, the
amount of <i>actual contact of it</i> is so limited in proportion
to the whole mass of animal matter to be preserved,
that some time must be allowed for <i>sufficient
saturation</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>When such indications appear, do not be discouraged
or allow the fears of the friends of the deceased
of your ultimate failure deter you, but continue to
persist in your work as you have been directed in
these pages, neglecting or omitting no part of the
process, allowing time enough for <i>thorough saturation</i>
of the body with the Preservative, and the case will
invariably come out all right, provided that the rules
have all been carefully followed, and in fact a body
under such careful and persistent treatment will present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>a better appearance after the third or fourth day
than before.</p>

<p class='c006'>I will here call your attention to the fact, if there
are any disagreeable odors in the room when you are
first called to attend the dead, a little of the Preservative
sprayed about the room will effectually deodorize
and disinfect it, rendering it at once pure and wholesome,
remembering that the Excelsior Preservative
will not stain or injure any clothing or fabric with
which it may come in contact.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Many of our customers sell large quantities of
the Preservative to disinfect sick-rooms. If sprayed
around the rooms it will purify and deodorize them
in five minutes, thereby arresting contagion. The
best way to deodorize a room or the house, is to suspend
a good-sized sponge saturated with the Preservative,
in each room, with a plate underneath to catch
the drip, and when dry saturate again from the plate.</p>

<p class='c006'>A little of the Preservative should be poured into
the chamber utensils, and it should also be sprinkled
or sprayed on articles coming into contact with the
infectious matter, also on the clothing of those attending
the sick before leaving the sick-room, in order to
avoid carrying the infection outside.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whenever the Preservative is used freely in sick-rooms
or throughout the house, where there is a case
of scarlet fever or diphtheria, there will be no further
spread of those diseases in the family. In this respect
the Preservative is invaluable, and the Undertaker
who wishes to push its sale on the merits of its value
as a disinfectant for sick-rooms, will find it called for
in time by nearly every family in his community.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Preservative has been successfully used in
epidemics of scarlet fever in many instances in the
past, preventing its further spread whenever it has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>been freely and faithfully applied; and although I
have no personal knowledge of its application as a
disinfectant and preventative in yellow fever epidemics,
I have no doubt whatever of its great usefulness
in confining that dread disease in narrow
limits, knowing from actual experience its effectiveness
in neutralizing and destroying septic matter and
all germs of contagion of every nature and kind.</p>

<p class='c005'>You will no doubt have customers who will only
buy the casket and who will not require your attendance
in laying out and caring for their dead, and we
would suggest a source of profit and advantage to
you in such cases in recommending the purchase of a
bottle or two of the Preservative with directions for
using on the face and exposed portions of the body,
and such other uses as may be appropriate in each
case. We can furnish the Preservative put up in
bottles, labeled with directions for its use by unprofessional
persons as a face application and as a disinfectant
and deodorizer.</p>

<p class='c006'>The greatly improved appearance of a body that
has been even so partially treated with the Preservative,
will not only make your customer’s investment in
it entirely satisfactory to them, but it will be also an
advertisement for and an aid to your business. It will
be, in a professional point of view, entirely proper in
such cases, and in cases of infectious diseases, to make
the Preservative an article of merchandise, as it will
aid in introducing and familiarizing the idea of embalming
in your community; and will not at all interfere
with, but will rather create a demand for your
services as an Embalmer, for the use of the Preservative
in such a limited way would only tend to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>popular its more extended use, but as we furnish it

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='VIII' class='c004'>CHAPTER VIII.<br> <span class='c014'>Embalming by Arterial Injection.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>If circumstances render it desirable that the body
shall be fully embalmed and preserved for an indefinite
length of time, the Arterial Circulation should be
filled with the Excelsior Preservative.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is essential that you should have a thorough
knowledge of all of the details of the methods used
for the preservation of the dead by partial embalming
or cavity injection as it is sometimes called, and
to have some experience in the care of the dead by
the processes already described, or at least to fully
understand them, as it is necessary for the very best
results from Arterial injection that the <i>entire process</i>
of preserving and partial embalming of a body should
be carefully and faithfully performed, according to
previous instructions, as it is equally as necessary as
the injecting of the Arterial Circulation, and <i>no part
or portion</i> of the previous instructions for preserving
should ever be omitted in a case of full embalming.</p>

<p class='c006'>You can very easily learn from any physician
where to find the arteries, how to distinguish them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>from the veins and nerves, and how to take them up
and inject them, and it will be only necessary for you
to have one ocular demonstration by your family
physician how the operation is performed which with
the minute directions I will now give you, will be
sufficient, in fact, quite a large number of our customers
who are now proficient in the art, have become so
without any teaching other than that they have
gained by reading and studying over carefully my
directions, and practicing, whenever there were opportunities,
and if you will procure the proper
instruments and practice by yourself alone (and you
will find many opportunities to practice upon subjects
not requiring full embalming) you can acquire the
necessary skill without personal instructions from any
one.</p>

<p class='c006'>Either of the three great arteries, viz: The
Carotid, Femoral or Brachial may be selected for the
operation, as it makes no difference in its effectiveness,
all of the arteries of the body inosculating or intercommunicating
with each other as well as being connected
at the heart as a central point.</p>

<p class='c006'>The arteries after death are flattened or collapsed,
which is due to the fact that the blood is congealed
in the veins, leaving the arteries empty and pale.
Every artery has its corresponding vein by its side
from which it is easily distinguished, as the veins are
of a bluish color, while the arteries are of a creamish
white. There is usually a nerve in close proximity to
the artery, and although nearly of the same color, it
may be distinguished by its being rounder and not
being hollow like the artery.  Taken between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>thumb and finger the artery has the feeling of a hollow
tube, while the nerve feels more solid to the touch
being filled with a fibrous substance, something of
the consistency of marrow.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Carotid or great Artery of the neck (see illustration)
being the largest one of the whole body, is
used for the injection by some Embalmers, but in
many cases it is necessary to avoid having the marks
of the incision show, as would be the case with children
dressed low in the neck. The Femoral, or main
artery of the thigh (see illustration) is also objectionable
from the necessary exposure while performing
the operation, and as the Arterial Circulation can be
filled equally as well from the Brachial or large
artery of the arm, I would advise its selection, and
as a rule, the confining of your practice to that
location, as it is best to be expert in performing the
operation by the one method rather than to be
awkward from lack of sufficient practice from trying
too many ways unless your opportunities for practicing
are greater than is ordinarily the case.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>The Carotid Artery lies nearer the surface, midway
between the angle of the lower jaw and the top
of the collar bone being deeper under the surface at
the bottom of the neck. It is, however, desirable to
make the incision as low in the neck as possible in order
to avoid leaving the marks of it visible. Begin the
incision on either side of the neck at a point half
way between the thyroid cartilage (or Adam’s apple)
and the top of the collar bone cutting downward.
By reference to the plate illustrating the location and
course of this artery you will note the place marked
for the incision. The course of the Carotid Artery is
in a line drawn from the angle or bend of the collar
bone where it joins the Sternum or breast bone,
upwards towards the ear, and it is at the side of and
almost touching the windpipe at the top of the collar
bone, but recedes backwards from the windpipe
and comes nearer to the surface as it passes
upwards. It is contained in a sheath which incloses
also the internal jugular vein which lies close to and
on the outer side of the artery.</p>

<p>See dotted line for place for making the incision.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Having taken up the artery, make a slit or cut in
it lengthwise about three eights of an inch in length
and insert the point of the syringe towards the body
(<i>never towards the head when you are injecting into the
Carotid Artery</i>), securing the artery to the syringe
point with strong thread; also tie the artery above the
syringe point, that nothing may run out from that
end of the slit. Now proceed to inject the Preservative
and continue to slowly force it into the artery as
long as you can do so with moderate pressure of the
syringe bulb, but discontinue when the veins in the
forehead begin to show a slight distention. Then let
it remain about two hours by which time the Capillary
veins will have absorbed a portion of the Preservative
already injected, when you will find it easy to inject
about one-third as much more into the artery.</p>

<p class='c006'>For most cases one injection is sufficient, but to
keep a body for months it is well to repeat the injection
the second day or the third day, the Preservative
being largely absorbed by that time. After
the injection is completed tie the artery below the
point of the syringe securely, remove the syringe
point, and sew up the cut.</p>

drawn from the outer side of the armpit to the
center of the bend of the elbow, and along the inner
edge of the Biceps or largest muscle of the upper
part of the arm (see illustration). This artery will
be found just at the inner edge of the Biceps, at a
point midway between the elbow and shoulder—sometimes
a little under the edge of the muscle in very
muscular subjects. Hold the arm out from the side
of the body, twisting it a little outwards, and make
the incision at the edge of the muscle. By reference
to the plate illustrating the location of this artery,
you will see the point marked for the incision. Having
taken up the artery, make the slit and secure
the syringe in it, the point directed towards the
shoulder, and proceed according to the general directions

</div>

<p class='c005'>The course of the Femoral Artery is in a line
drawn from the inner side of the knee upwards to a
point midway between the outside of the hip-bone
and inside of the thigh (see illustration). It is nearest
the surface and is taken up and injected the most
readily at a point about two inches below the lower
edge or fold of the groin. By reference to the plate
illustrating the course of this artery, the place for
injection will be found marked. Having taken the
artery up and made the slit, secure the syringe with
the point directed upwards, <i>i. e.</i>, towards the body,
and proceed with the injection in the same manner as
with the other arteries. The Femoral Artery is
seldom used, however, the Brachial, and next to that
the Carotid Artery, being usually preferred.</p>

<p class='c006'>All bodies should be laid out upon an inclined
plane (45 degrees is not too much), particularly
during the process of embalming, as by thus inclining
the body, the slight bloating of the face, caused
by the filling of the arterial circulation with the
Preservative, will soon pass off and a life-like expression
remain.</p>

  <h2 id='XII' class='c004'>CHAPTER XII.<br> <span class='c014'>Precautions to observe for the Safety of the Operator in Embalming.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Should you cut or prick your hand or fingers in
any way while handling the dead, be sure and apply
the Preservative <span class='fss'>AT ONCE</span> to the wound, as it will
insure safety from the inoculation of the poison virus
by which many undertakers have lost their lives. I
would also say to the undertaker, in every instance
where he is called upon to lay out the dead, to first
bathe his hands with the Preservative; this insures
perfect safety and should never be omitted, for you
can not tell at just what point you will meet with this
deadly virus; and as I have before stated, the Preservative
in this respect is positively indispensable to the
undertaker.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have already spoken in the highest praise of the
Excelsior Preservative, but the half has not been told.
The undertaker who places any estimate on the value
of his own life, can not afford to be without this <i>all
important antidote</i> against the dangerous inoculation
of the poison or deadly virus which he is liable to
encounter at any moment in handling the dead.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is a very dangerous thing in any contingency to
handle the dead, notwithstanding it has been done
thousands of times without injury to the undertaker,
yet this is due to great precaution on his part, or from
the fact of his hands being in perfect condition, having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>no scratch, cracks, hang-nails, or abrasion of the
skin through which the poison could be inoculated
into his system, whereas, others with a simple scratch
or hang-nail that they were not aware of until too
late, have thus been poisoned and lost their lives.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cases of purging or sloughing of the skin are of
the worst type, these juices being fearfully
poisonous, and the longer the body lays without
treatment the worse it grows, hence the more dangerous
to handle; therefore I say, it matters not what
the undertaker charges for his services, he is never
half paid for the risk he runs of losing his own life
while fulfilling the duties of his profession in handling
and taking care of the dead.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is no public servant that takes upon himself
one-half the personal risk, or whose services should
be better appreciated by the community than those
of the professional undertaker, and when the customer
complains of prices, or where the undertaker’s charges
are brought in question, these facts should be fully
explained.</p>

<p class='c006'>A fatal case happened under my own personal
observation in California where the undertaker laid
out a Chinaman that was purging at the mouth.
Some of the poisonous fluid got into a hang-nail, and
in three days he died, although a council of physicians
was called, but nothing devised or prescribed could
help him, simply for the want of a perfect antidote
like the Excelsior Preservative, which, if applied, as
directed in this manual, is a certain preventative
against the deadly ravages of this virus. And I
will once more say to the undertaker, you must be on
your guard at <i>all times</i>, and as self-preservation is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>paramount to all other considerations in matters of
this kind, be sure to bathe your hands in the
Preservative before commencing to handle or lay out
the dead, and also bathing them with it thoroughly
<i>immediately afterwards</i>.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XIII' class='c004'>CHAPTER XIII.<br> <span class='c014'>Chemical Affinities.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>I will here give a few of the reasons why the
Excelsior Preservative will do all that I represent.</p>

<p class='c006'>To those who are acquainted with chemical laws,
hardly any discovery seems too strange to be true.
Chemical laws and their affinities are truly wonderful,
and if we are to produce a certain result on the dead
human system, we must make use of chemicals that
have affinities for the parts to be acted upon, and no
affinity whatever for those parts that we desire to
leave intact or undisturbed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Careful study and experience have taught me that
albumen and gluten are the principal if not the only
putrescible substances with which we have to deal in
the preservation of the dead.</p>

<p class='c006'>Putrescent gases and odors which originate from
the decomposition of those substances, partake largely
of their nature, and even carry with them minute
atoms of the corrupted mass into the air we breathe,
and it matters not whether this putrid and offensive
matter exist in the air or flesh, where the Excelsior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Preservative comes in contact with it the air is at
once cleansed and rendered wholesome, or the flesh
preserved. My Preservative is made from chemicals
that act directly upon the albumen and gluten, uniting
with them to form a new compound, and the
compound so formed becomes a new substance, and
this has an affinity for the hitherto unaffected constituency
of the flesh, which all combine to form a
new, pure, and imputrescible whole; by this means
changing the corruptible mass into a <i>perfectly preserved
body for all time</i>. The Excelsior Preservative being
infinitely superior and paramount to all other preparations
known to man in either ancient or modern times
for the preservation of the human body in its natural
and life-like appearance.</p>

  <h2 id='XIV' class='c004'>CHAPTER XIV.<br> <span class='c014'>Advantages to the Undertaker of Scientific Embalming.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>With the aid of this Manual, the enterprising
Undertaker will soon find himself master of the
situation, and no case, however complicated or obstinate,
will be able to baffle his skill, and as there is
not a town or city in the land in which there is not
an occasional death of some person whose remains
are removed to a distant place for interment, and as
a great many of Undertakers are not skilled in the
art of partial or full embalming, many such cases are
of necessity either sent in a putrid state or shipped
in an ice-box, to the <i>very great annoyance and inconvenience</i>
of the friends of the deceased, when if the
local Undertaker had been properly skilled in the
preservation and embalming of the dead, the friends
could have been gratified by not only having a
proper funeral at its destination, but they would
have had the satisfaction of the remains presenting
a perfect and life-like appearance. The Undertaker
who will give this part of the profession a little careful
study and attention, will find that nothing will
pay him better, for as soon as the people find out
that he is really a professional undertaker, they will
gladly rely upon him, and his services will be more
and more appreciated by the educated and refined
portion of the people, who always want this class of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>work well done, and are willing to pay and do pay
for it whenever the Undertaker can convince them
that he really understands the requirements of his
profession.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have been told hundreds of times, by persons
who have lost relatives or friends, that they would
have given $50, $100 or $200, or even $300, if they
could only have had them preserved or embalmed for
even two or three weeks, and much more if they
could have had them fully embalmed. Therefore I
say that there is nothing that can possibly pay the
Undertaker better than to educate himself up to a full
knowledge of the requirements of his profession, and
it certainly is a very great inducement for him to
do so when it is so easily done with the aid of the
Excelsior Preservative and the instructions which I
have laid before you.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>
  <h2 id='XV' class='c004'>CHAPTER XV.<br> <span class='c014'>Absorption by the Capillaries.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It is a well established fact that the capillaries or
pores of the skin absorb liquids and many substances
when in solution, as well as being channels of excretion
of waste matter from the system.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Draper’s Human Physiology” (a standard
authority) says, page 241: “Besides exercising the
functions of exhalation and perspiration, numerous
facts demonstrate that the skin exerts an absorbent
action. The endermic application of remedial agents
establishes this in a satisfactory manner. That water
can find access in this way is shown by the assuaging
of the thirst which may occur on taking a bath; nor
is the amount insignificant, since it may give rise to
a considerable increase of weight.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Salivation may be procured by the external application
of mercurial preparations, the peculiar constitutional
effects of cantharides (Spanish flies) on the
urinary organs may occur from their external contact
with the skin, and a multitude of such instances can
be adduced to show the tendency to absorption
through the pores of the skin.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the above established facts, the risk in
using poisonous substances for embalming purposes—more
particularly solutions of arsenic—is greater than
is generally realized. This deadly poison (arsenic) is
so peculiarly diffusive and penetrating that it is even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>injurious to sleep in rooms papered with green wall-paper,
the green coloring matter used in printing
such colors on wall-paper being an arsenical preparation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Contact of the naked skin with any arsenical
solution is attended with risk in exact proportion to
the extent and duration of such contact, the thickness
of the skin, and some other modifications, as, for
instance, this deadly poison (arsenic) will be absorbed
more readily through the pores of the back of the
hand than through the calloused palm, much more
readily through the epithelial covering of the lips
than other better protected parts of the body, and
even if the Embalmer is careless of the consequences
to himself from using such dangerous material for
his work, he is in duty bound to take into consideration
when using embalming preparations that the
friends and relatives often take a parting kiss from
the face of their dead after the application of such
preparations, and he should use none that contain
any such dangerous ingredients.</p>

<p class='c006'>All such risks, both to the Embalmer himself and
to all who come into contact in any manner with the
dead, are entirely avoided when using the Excelsior
Preservative. It is a perfect antidote, not only for
septic poisoning from contact with infectious matter
in handling dead bodies, but also a sure antidote to
the dangerous effects arising from the use of any
poisonous solutions that may be used for embalming
purposes; and if for any reason such are used, or if
there is any suspicion of danger of being inoculated
with poisonous matter, I would urge for your own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>safety and protection that you freely use the Preservative,
bathing your hands or any part that may be
exposed to contact with the poison, as the free application
of the Preservative will neutralize and destroy
the poisonous matter and prevent any unpleasant or
serious consequences.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Preservative is not only perfectly harmless in
its external contact with living flesh, but it is even
remarkably curative in its effects when applied to
chapped hands, sores, or even fresh cuts. This is, as a
matter of course, outside of its legitimate use as an
Embalming preparation, and I refer to it only as
indicating the radical difference between the arsenical
and other poisonous solutions (<i>the so-called “fluids”</i>)
and the Excelsior Preservative, which last contains
no such dangerous ingredients.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Much can be accomplished in restoring and
retaining the natural appearance and color of the
exposed portions of a dead body, and decomposition
can be retarded for a time by using the Preservative
freely externally and without the aid of instruments,
wetting clothes with it and applying to the face, neck,
and hands to restore and retain their natural color,
and also over the bowels where decomposition first sets
in, which application will delay its progress for a
time, as the Preservative is very penetrating, but a
good set of Embalming instruments are almost
indispensable for every undertaker to be possessed of,
as there will often be cases where there is a necessity
for cavity injection to hold the body a number of days
for the arrival of distant friends, and occasionally for
Arterial Embalming for shipment to long distances.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would be out of place for us to advertise our
Instruments in a work of this kind, and we would
simply say that we invite correspondence in regard
to Instruments desirable for use. We would prefer
to supply our customers with a good set of Instruments
at a nominal price to cover the cost of
manufacture rather than to have them remain without
them or be using inferior ones, as the best results in
Embalming are attained only with the best tools
which rule holds good in every kind of work.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>We have on hand Instruments of every description
for every kind of Embalming work, from sets consisting
of those used only for partial embalming, up
to complete sets in elegant Cabinets with every tool
required for any purpose. Our syringe has a screw
fitting turned on the suction end so that any of the
tubes or the Gas-trocar can be fitted on and collections
of fluid in the body pumped out with it.</p>

<p class='c006'>All the tubes and the Gas-trocar are nickel plated
and non-corrosive, and we would call especial
attention to our improved Gas-trocar which is the
most complete tool of its kind ever manufactured
being superior to any other as it is so constructed that
it will not clog.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sets of Instruments will be sent to our customers
on approval if desired.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>It is of the greatest importance that the Preservative
be kept entirely <i>free from mixture</i> with any
other substance, as, owing to the peculiar combination
of the chemicals used in the process of its manufacture,
an addition of even a small portion of any foreign
substances, especially any of the <i>Arsenical Solutions</i>
sometimes used for embalming purposes, will completely
change its character and destroy some of its
most valuable properties.</p>

<p class='c006'>We call particular attention to this matter as we
have more than once traced up the cause for a complaint
of the quality of some particular shipment of
the Preservative to the fact that the customer has
had one or more kinds of “<i>fluid</i>” on hand and in some
careless moment has emptied back some little left
over, into the package containing our Preservative to
its very great injury. Even keeping the Preservative
in wood totally destroys its efficiency as an Embalming
preparation and therefore it should never
under contingency be kept in wooden packages. It
should always be kept in the glass packages in which
it is shipped, or in some other glass vessel.</p>

<p class='c006'>Every package that is sent out is exactly like
every other package in regard to the quality of the
Preservative it contains, and its contents will never
deteriorate in any length of time it may be kept
providing that no other substance be added.</p>

they begin to see it now differently. As an illustration, I
will give you a case I had last season: A lady died and
some of the family were in Florida, and they wished the
body kept until their return. I embalmed the body with
your Preservative and after it had laid in the house a
week the neighbors began to make a fuss, and threatened
to complain to the Board of Health, and annoyed the family
so that they requested me to remove the body to my
house; I did so, keeping it in the casket and kept it two
weeks longer. When the friends arrived the body was
shipped then 150 miles and buried, and it was in much
better condition when buried than the day she died—no
smell or signs of decay whatever.</p>

the remains were not buried on the day of the funeral.
Although apparently dead, the usual evidences of dissolution
are not present and there are no signs of it visible.
The young lady before her death exacted a promise from
her mother that she should not be buried until she was
satisfied she was really dead. The remains will not be
interred until her death is established beyond all question
of dispute.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It seems they were not satisfied that she was dead
until the seventh day afterwards. There could have been
no question, however, of her death, as she was regularly
embalmed by me, and the life-like appearance was due to
the Preservative used.</p>

Preservative, and last week I had my first case of embalming—an
old man who died from dysentery, and the
friends wanted the body kept until relatives arrived from
Kansas. I had never used any Fluid or seen any embalming
done, but had got posted from your Manual by reading
it over. The doctors said that it would be of no use
to try to keep the body without ice, as it would be “as
black as your hat” in 24 hours, in such weather; but I told
them it could be kept all right if I could have my way,
and after a while the friends consented to it, but procured
some ice so as to have it ready. I followed out your
instructions exactly, using about a gallon of the Preservative,
and at the time of the funeral the body looked as
natural as life.</p>

It was the wife of a prominent citizen, and it was

have known her. We went to work with the Preservative
and followed the instructions of your Manual, and
the appearance of the body improved every day, and at
the end of five days many people said it was the handsomest
corpse that they had ever seen. We were a little
anxious ourselves about the results, it being our first case,

I kept a body this week four days, extremely

case, of a very fleshy man: I was called some time after
death and found body bloated and smelling very bad, also
turning dark. I treated it with your Preservative, and at
the funeral he looked as white as in life—no smell, and
bloating all gone down. I am better pleased with the

moved so many times, so perfect was the preservation and
so natural the expression that it was remarked: ‘He is
not dead, but sleeping.’ Every one who beheld Mrs. Stern’s
countenance will bear testimony to its perfectly life-like
appearance, and that she lay as if asleep in her casket on
the morning of the funeral. Taking into consideration
the extremely hot weather; the manner of death and the

  <h2 class='c004'>NOTE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>We would more particularly urge upon your attention
the care that should be taken in keeping this <span class='sc'>Manual
of Instruction</span> from the observation of any person
other than yourself, for reasons which we trust will
appear plain to you; that, as it contains all of the <i>practical
knowledge of the present day</i> on the subject of
Embalming, so plainly demonstrated in the Manual as
to be easily acquired by any person who might have the
opportunity of studying the book; therefore it is clearly
in your interest to keep it in such a safe place that no
one but yourself can have access to it, otherwise it might
be the very means of educating and qualifying some
person who might sooner or later come into competition
with you, to the great injury of your business.</p>

<p class='c006'>We endeavor to protect our customers by refusing to
fill all orders for the Preservative from any persons who
are not regularly engaged in the Undertaking business,
and <i>we would not furnish the Manual</i> to any other than
our customers under any circumstances. See card pasted
on inside of the front cover.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>TO OUR CUSTOMERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A few of our customers have, from time to time,
called us to order (as it were) by reason of the cost of the
Excelsior Preservative, and to such we would say that
the first cost to manufacture the Preservative is from
five to eight times more than any of the poison water
“Fluids” that have ever come under our observation, and
among all classes of merchandise, we know of nothing
that is put on the market at so small a margin of profit
as the Excelsior Preservative. We are now down to bed
rock, with only a very small margin above actual cost.
Nevertheless, we are sticking to it by reason of the continued
increase of trade, which we trust in time will
enable us to say that large sales and small profits are
sure to win in the long run.</p>

<p class='c006'>We trust that this explanation will be satisfactory to
those of our customers who have written us, and will
only say in conclusion that a small reduction in price
would now drive us out of the market, which we feel
sure you would regret.</p>

<p class='c006'>We ask your patronage and support in order that we
can continue to float the only <i>honest and reliable</i> article
of its kind that has ever been put on the market, at the
smallest possible margin of profits.</p>
